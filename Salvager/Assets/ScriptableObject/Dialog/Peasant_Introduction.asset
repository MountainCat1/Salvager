  - <Text>k__BackingField: 'Hello there! What brings you here? '
  - <Text>k__BackingField: Hm..? I suppose you're not a talkative type...
  - <Text>k__BackingField: I guess I will share some information with ya!
  - <Text>k__BackingField: East of here there are kobolds. Those nasty pests always
      have something of value if you are interested.
  - <Text>k__BackingField: You can head west, and you will arrive in Ironvile - a
      small mining town.
  - <Text>k__BackingField: South? I would not go south. Bandits are patrolling those
      roads, so I would stay away.
  - <Text>k__BackingField: That's all I have to say. So... don't bother me.
  - <Text>k__BackingField: Except if you have some good beverage... I would love
      a good beverage.
